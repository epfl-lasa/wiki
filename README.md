# EPFL LASA Wiki
**Welcome!** This is the wiki for the LASA laboratory and contains a collection of best practices, 
conventions, manuals, instructions, and other resources for all people at the LASA. The main goals 
of the wiki is to provide help to newcomers, to give directions and suggestions to researchers 
to unify and popularize the software stack, and to prevent knowledge drain.

- :books: **Read**: Go over to the [wiki](https://github.com/epfl-lasa/wiki/wiki) and browse its contents.

Maintaining such a wiki can be cumbersome and require some effort from all of us. The more people use and contribute to 
this wiki, the more effective and successful our research at the LASA will be - so spread the word!
