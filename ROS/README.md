# ROS Package Templates

This folder contains template packages for the Robotic Operating System (ROS) for C++ and Python.

The main goal of these templates is to standardize the structure of ROS packages at the LASA. Every new package created
in future is expected to adopt this structure.

Before you use these templates, please visit the corresponding Wiki pages for [C++]()
and [Python](https://github.com/epfl-lasa/wiki/wiki/ROS-Python-Package-Structure-and-Best-Practices).

**NOTE: This part of the wiki is currently under development. If you decide to adopt this structure and issues arise or
you have questions / improvements regarding this topic, please contact the maintainers of the wiki to start a
discussion.**
